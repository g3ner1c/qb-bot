# qb-bot

An open source quizbowl discord bot.

All data is sourced from [QB Reader](https://www.qbreader.org/) via its [API](https://www.qbreader.org/api-info).

Contributions are welcome! I licensed this under [AGPLv3](./LICENSE) specifically to encourage open source contributions.

## Features

There are a lot of feature ideas in my head for this bot, but I'm not sure how many I'll actually get around to implementing.
If you have any feature requests, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
